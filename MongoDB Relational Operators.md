MongoDB provides several relational operators to perform comparisons within queries. These operators allow you to filter documents based on specific conditions, such as greater than, less than, or equality.

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$eq`        | Matches values that are equal to a specified value.                                               |
| `$ne`        | Matches values that are not equal to a specified value.                                           |
| `$gt`        | Matches values that are greater than a specified value.                                           |
| `$gte`       | Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.                               |

| `$lte`       | Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.                                  |
